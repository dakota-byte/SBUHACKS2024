# DoodleDash
Website made for fun during SBUHacks 2024!!

## Inspiration
This game is inspired by Gartic Phone and BeReal.  
The plan was to have a BeReal style application where you have 2 minutes to draw something quick and cute (hence the gartic phone part)!  
Bringing friends together and creating for some great laughs.

## Inspiration
We used React for the front end with express for route handling.   
We also created an API using Python and Flask for communicating with our MongoDB database, which we used for storing our images in URI encoded base64 format.   
We also used Chakra UI to create the appealing styling!

## Challenges we ran into
It took us way, and I really mean WAYYY ( like I cannot possibly exaggerate how awfully long it took ) for our backend member to set up the back end.  Like it was seriously just getting sad at one point. (Dakota is so silly for writing this ðŸ˜­) 

Originally we would have users authenticate with discord. 4 hours later we scratched that.  
We tried SQL but did not like the local environment setup required.  
After a few more grueling hours, we got into mongoDB and figured out that flask was a lot easier to set up than express...

## Accomplishments that we're proud of'
We all used React for the first time! We are EXTREMELY proud of how much we learned, going from 0 front end experience to creating what we actually though looked really nice. Of course there is a lot more to learn, but we seriously went from zero to a minimum viable product. And although we had to cut features along the way to meet the deadline, we made it!

## What we learned
We learned the importance of cutting losses. We could have put more focus into other aspects if we tried other avenues when we got stuck. Overall though, we learned a lot about react and express/flask. We build a create understanding of how to create websites!

## What's next for DoodleDash
DoodleDash was meant to have a timer, because that is honestly what makes Gartic Phone the most fun. You were also supposed to be able to comment on other peoples doodles. Next up, we could even create a phone app!
